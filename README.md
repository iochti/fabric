iochti Kubernetes deployment on AWS using Terraform and kops

## Before creating the kubernetes cluster

To store the terraform configuration generated by kops, you need to create a S3 bucket, you can do so by using:
```shell
# Creates an s3 store
./bin/create-s3-state-store.sh
```

## Creating the kubernetes cluster on AWS

You can (re)generate the terraform files by using
```
# Set terraform backend from main.tf file
terraform init -backend=true
# Generates terraform files terraform/ directory
bin/kops-create-cluster.sh
```

You then have to go in `terraform/` and use `terraform apply`. This will create the cluster
